- Merton Model
  - PD: 1- N(d2)
    - T = 1: d2 ~= (lnV - lnK) / o
  - credit spread
  - assume just zero-coupons, no jump on firm value; asset follows lognormal with constant variance
  - works better on debt below investment grade ()
- Moody's KMV
  - DD: (V - K) / o
  - PD: historical default rate to DD
- PD * LGF ~= CS

- Credit analysis of Fin: importance of asset quality; omission of cash flow
- cumulative prob of default increases over time, good companies will eventually fail
- Credit spread = LGD * PD = (1-RR)*PD
- value of suboridinate debt: low PD, similiar to senior debt; high PD, equity
- diversification helps unexpected loss
- Credit VaR = credit loss - expected loss
- SMM = prepayment / (beg.bal = scheduled prinicpal payment)
- (1- SMM)^12 = 1 - CPR
- 100% PSA => CPR=0.2
