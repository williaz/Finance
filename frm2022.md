#### normal VaR
- arithmetic return: Rt ~ normal

#### lognormal VaR
- ln(Pt/Pt-1) ~ normal


#### Quantile-Quantile Plots
- x: normal quantile
- y: empirial quantile
- compare distribution with normal


#### ES(expected shortfall) conditional VaR
- confidence level x sample = xth

#### Hybrid
- age-weighted (AW)
- volatility weighted (HW/Hull-White)
  - adjust historical return by vol
- correlation-weighed, HW
- Filtered weighted: GARCH

#### Extreme value
- block max to choose: GEV(Generalized ev)
- POT: peak over thredhold: genzd Pareto dist


#### Backtesting VaR
- failing rate: %
- Type 1: reject truth; Type 2: accept false <>power of test
- Kupiec VaR: fat tail, LR > 3.841
- horizon: holding period
- Basel: 99% 2.5 excp per year

#### VaR mapping
- VaR(principle) > duration > cash flow undiversified > diversefied
- 


- spectual risk measure: with weighted

#### Integrated Risk Measurement
- compartmentalised: sum, p = 1, Basel
- unified appoach: p != 1


#### FRTB
- markeet risk capital
- 97.5% ES, 250d
- IMA(Internal model-based approach)

- credit spread risk: 99% 10d VaR as market risk
- Jump t- default risk: 1y, 99.9% VaR


#### correlation swap
- paying fixed = buying corr
- like long put on index, sell put on stocks

- corr peak in recession, vol of corr high in normal
- time dependency of credit risk: 1. investment grade: longer time, higher adverse events; 2. distressed: longer, decrease

#### copula
- stats: joining multiple univariate dist to a single multivariate dist

#### Principal componenets analysis
- 3 PC
