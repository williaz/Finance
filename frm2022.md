#### normal VaR
- arithmetic return: Rt ~ normal

#### lognormal VaR
- ln(Pt/Pt-1) ~ normal


#### Quantile-Quantile Plots
- x: normal quantile
- y: empirial quantile
- compare distribution with normal


#### ES(expected shortfall) conditional VaR
- confidence level x sample = xth

#### Hybrid
- age-weighted (AW)
- volatility weighted (HW/Hull-White)
  - adjust historical return by vol
- correlation-weighed, HW
- Filtered weighted: GARCH

#### Extreme value
- block max to choose: GEV(Generalized ev)
- POT: peak over thredhold: genzd Pareto dist


#### Backtesting VaR
- failing rate: %
- Type 1: reject truth; Type 2: accept false <>power of test
- Kupiec VaR: fat tail, LR > 3.841
- horizon: holding period
- Basel: 99% 2.5 excp per year

#### VaR mapping
- VaR(principle) > duration > cash flow undiversified > diversefied
- 


- spectual risk measure: with weighted

#### Integrated Risk Measurement
- compartmentalised: sum, p = 1, Basel
- unified appoach: p != 1


#### FRTB
- markeet risk capital
- 97.5% ES, 250d
- IMA(Internal model-based approach)

- credit spread risk: 99% 10d VaR as market risk
- Jump t- default risk: 1y, 99.9% VaR


#### correlation swap
- paying fixed = buying corr
- like long put on index, sell put on stocks

- corr peak in recession, vol of corr high in normal
- time dependency of credit risk: 1. investment grade: longer time, higher adverse events; 2. distressed: longer, decrease

#### copula
- stats: joining multiple univariate dist to a single multivariate dist

#### Principal componenets analysis
- 3 PC

#### Constant Maturity treasury swap


- BSM can't apply to fixed income derivative
- 
#### Jensen's Inequality
- convexity effect (, 2 bonds' prices' diff
- E\[1 / (1+r)] >  1/ E\[1+r]

#### Vasicek
- half-lifr: T = ln2 / k

#### Volatility smile
- Pmkt - Pbsm = Cmkt - Pbsm
- implied vol lowest at-the-money
- reason forex: vol change and jump
- shape: forex: bell; equity: e

## Credit Risk
### Identification
- default, recovery, exposure risks
- EL(=PDxLGDxEAD) vs unexpected loss(Credit VaR=WCL -EL) $calc

- default correlation #calc

- CF not important for financial firms

- Economic capital <= UL
- CAMEL

### Measurement
- rating sys: S&P on issuer, Moody's on issues


- investment grade: >= BBB-, Baa3
- specualte grade: <= BB+, Ba1


- CVA BCVA calc: standard, approx
- Incremental marginal CVA
- WWR: wrong way risk: product, impact on CVA

- funding exposure ignore default factor

- CDS
- TRS
- CLN/credit linked note: note + credit protection
- digital CDS: pre-agreed payment
- SPV
  - amortizing structure
  - revolving
  - master trust: combine
- tranching
- waterfall

- covered bond
- CDO/collaterilzed debt obligation

- CPR(constant prepayment rate)
- PSA(public Securities Association)


- default correlation 

- Z-score: > 2.675 vs default

- FICO: > 660 prime
- DTIL debt to income ratio
- LTV: loan
- paytement type(pmt)


## Liq

- Liq trading risk: LVaR = VaR \[(1+T)(1+2T)/6T]^0.5
- Liq Funding risk
  - maturity mismatch, liquidity transform
  - Liq Coverage Ratio: short term, high liq assets / 1 mon outflow >= 100%
  - NSFR(net stable fundig ratio): long term, 1 yr

- repo
- Reserve rules: totoal liq req = 0.95 hot money + 0.3 vulnerable deposit + 0.15 (stable dep - legal reserves) + 1.0 (potential - actual loans outstanding)

#### LTP
- 0 cost of funds approach: no liq cost
- Pooled avg cost: same for any type
- matched-maturity : charge more on LT

- Liq cushion
- ALCO(asset-liablity committee): treasury, ind risl mag func, internal audit
- CFP(a contingency funding paln): hing impact low prob events
- LCT(liq crisis team)
- AFG, available funds gap


- Intraday flow: $
- risk levels %


- cross currency swap: swap at prev spot rate
- dollar shortage, basis > 0
