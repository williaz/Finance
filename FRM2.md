### 1
#### Explain and calculate liquidity trading risk via cost of liquidation and liquidity-adjusted VaR (LVaR).
- Solvency refers to a company having more assets than liabilities so that the value of its equity is positive. Liquidity refers to the ability of a company to make cash payments as they become due. 
- short notice
- bid–offer spreads

- Cost of liquidation = {(bid-offer spread) / (2* mid-market price)}  * position


#### Identify liquidity funding risk, funding sources, and lessons learned from real cases: Northern Rock, Ashanti Goldfields, and Metallgesellschaft.
-  Liquidity stresses in the economy,  Overly aggressive funding decisions(liq mismatch), A poor financial performance, lead to a lack of confidence. 

- Northern Rock: can't reply on selling short term debt
- Ashanti Goldfields: margin call on hedge position due to policy surprise
- Metallgesellschaft: can't handle cash flow mismatch due to short term market change

#### Evaluate Basel III liquidity risk ratios and BIS principles for sound liquidity risk management.

- LCR: High-quality liquid assets/Net cash outflows in a 30-day period >= 100%

#### Explain liquidity black holes and identify the causes of positive feedback trading


- A liquidity black hole describes a situation where liquidity has dried up in a particular market because everyone wants to sell and no one wants to buy, or vice versa.

- trend trade, stop loss/margin call, option/hedging/synthetics/predatory trading
- There are two types of liquidity risk: liquidity trading risk and liquidity funding risk.

### 2

#### Differentiate between sources of liquidity risk and describe specific challenges faced by different types of financial institutions in managing liquidity risk.

- Maturity mismatch: Funding liquidity risk arises for market participants who bor-row at short term to finance investments that require a longer time to become profitable.



#### Summarize the asset-liability management process at a fractional reserve bank, including the process of liquidity transformation.



● Compare transactions used in the collateral market and explain risks that can arise through collateral market transactions.
● Describe the relationship between leverage and a firm’s return profile (including the leverage effect) and distin-guish the impact of different types of transactions on a firm’s leverage and balance sheet.

- Liquidity Coverage Ratio: The ratio of the stock of high-quality liquid assets to the net cash outflows over 30 days must be greater than 100%.


### 3
#### Evaluate the characteristics of sound Early Warning Indica-tors (EWI) measures.

Rapid asset growth, especially when funded with potentially volatile liabilities 

Growing concentrations in assets or liabilities 

Increases in currency mismatches 

Decrease of weighted average maturity of liabilities 

Repeated incidents of positions approaching or breaching internal or regulatory limits 

Negative trends or heightened risk associated with a particular product line 

Significant deterioration in the bank’s financial condition 

Negative publicity Credit rating downgrade Stock price declines 

Rising debt costs 

Widening debt/credit-default-swap spreads 

Rising wholesale/retail funding costs 

Counterparties requesting additional collateral or resisting entering into new transactions 

Drop in credit lines Increasing retail deposit outflows 

Increasing redemptions of CDs before maturity 

Difficulty accessing longer-term fuunding 

Difficulty placing short-term liabilities

#### Identify EWI guidelines from banking regulators and supervisors (OCC, BCBS, Federal Reserve).


#### Discuss the applications of EWIs in the context of the liquidity risk management process


### 4

#### Compare various money market and capital market instruments and discuss their advantages and disadvantages.

1) money market instruments, which reach maturity within one year and are noted for their low risk and ready marketability and 
2) capital market instruments, which have remaining maturities beyond one year and are generally noted for their higher expected rate of return and capital gains potential.

#### Identify and discuss various factors that affect the choice of investment securities by a bank.

- 

#### Apply investment maturity strategies and maturity management tools based on the yield curve and duration.

- the yield curve is simply a picture of how market interest rates differ across loans and securities of varying term (time) to maturity.
- Risk-Return Trade-Offs: current trade-offs between greater returns and greater risks
- Pursuing the Carry Trade: steep upward slope, borrow money to buy
- Riding the Yield Curve: 

- portfolio immunization: duration = sell time
